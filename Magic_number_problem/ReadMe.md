Problem statement: </h1>
<p>
There are multiple rounds ðŸ‘¾. In each round, the user gives the model a range [a,b] where a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit,both included. The user also selects a particular number (which we refer to as a magic number in this problem) which he doesn't reveal to the model, but keeps it a secret ! The model must initially guess a number. If the initial guess itself matches the secret magic number, then the next round begins. Else the model must make a second guess. If the second guessed number is closer to the magic number compared to the first number then the user enters +1 else -1.

Given:
All numbers are natural numbers only that integers greater than or equal to 1
